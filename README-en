**Good tools are inherently simple.**

> If an operation/writing style feels overly complex, one should reflect on whether the method of use is problematic.

**Clarity · Conciseness · Aesthetics · Pleasant to Read**

**The Core Question: Does it match/Is it appropriate?**

## Chapter Arrangement

> This! This! This! --> 《[How to Write a Paper_WNN](如何写论文_WNN.pdf)》

- Chapter/Section Titles: Be concise; avoid being too long.
- Add **subheadings** to make the overall structure clearer.
  - You can also use a short phrase as a heading at the beginning of a paragraph, in **bold**.
  - The content under a single subheading should not exceed:
    - One and a half pages (for Chinese theses, or English single-column templates with large spacing, e.g., ECCV).
    - Half a column (for English double-column templates, e.g., CVPR).

- References:
  - Information must be complete: author names, conference/journal names, etc. Ensure format consistency (capitalization, abbreviations, etc.).
  - Add a `space` before citations like `\cite{}` or `\ref{}`.

- Paragraphs:
  - **Recommended length: 10-15 lines. Avoid being too long (exceeding 1/3 of a page) or too short (less than 5 lines).**
  - **Avoid large blank spaces except at the end of a chapter/section.**
  - **If a chapter or paragraph is only a few lines long and spills onto the next page, try to condense it onto the previous page.**
  - **The last line of a paragraph: should contain at least 5 characters.**

- Argumentation should be **rigorous** and concise.
  - Key concepts, mathematical symbols: their origin, usage, and meaning must be clear.
  - Do not assume only you or a small circle of peers will understand. Reviewer selection is somewhat random.
  - Continuously provide corresponding references at key points.
  - **Arguments must be supported, evidenced by providing references, figures, tables, or formulas, not just text.**

## LaTeX

```
Readability counts
```

- **Clear Structure**
  - Every chapter, figure, table, and formula should have a **short** `\label`.
    - E.g., `\label{sec:intro}`, `\label{ssec:cnn}`,
    - `\label{fig:pipeline}`, `\label{tab:comp}`, `\label{eq:comp}`
  - Consider using separate `.tex` files for each chapter.
  - Add a few lines of spacing before and after each chapter, figure, table, and `\section` title to visualize the overall structure easily.
  - In the main text, leave a blank line between paragraphs; do not use `\\`.
  - Unless necessary (or permitted), avoid using `\vspace` to adjust vertical spacing.

- **Formulas**
  - For standalone equations, use the `equation` environment. Do not use `$$x$$`. Use numbering.
  - Do not leave blank lines before `\begin{equation}` and after `\end{equation}`: this can cause excessive spacing or incorrect indentation of following text (e.g., "where").
  - Uppercase letters in formulas (excluding variables) should use `\mathrm{X}` or `\text{X}`, otherwise they look bad.

- **Figures and Tables**
  - Do not place them immediately after a title (like `\section`). They can be placed before the title. Leave a few lines of space before `\begin{}` and after `\end{}`.
  - It is recommended to use `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` for horizontal lines in tables; avoid using `\hline`.
  - It is recommended to use a **three-line table** format. Avoid too many vertical or horizontal lines, as it becomes messy.
  - You can use `\footnotesize` (to change font size) or `\tabcolsep=2pt` (to adjust column spacing) to adjust table size.
    - Do not use parameters like `\resizebox` to resize formulas or tables.
  - Quantitative indicators in tables: **The total number of integer and decimal digits generally should not exceed 4** (keep consistent across different metrics).
    - E.g.: `0.1234`, `1.234`, `12.34`
  - For figure size, generally use `[width=1\linewidth]`.

### Drawing Figures

```
Beautiful is better than ugly. 
```
- **Visual Elements Reflect Logical Relationships**: One should basically understand the paper's method (framework, structure, innovations) just by looking at the figures.
- **Color Scheme**
  - Use no more than 4 colors, plus black at most.
  - Colors should not be too bright/glaring. The default colors in PowerPoint are good (the matrix with gradients).
  - The same module should use the same color palette; you can use shades to distinguish sub-modules.
  - For theses: Figures should avoid large areas of background fill color, as it may look bad when printed.
- **Size/Color: Does it match?**
  - The **size and color** of a module should match its **importance** and the **amount of information** it conveys.
  > Therefore, arrows should not be too long or colorful; rounded rectangle corners should not be too large.
- Text in figures: **Use the same font size; do not use bold**. Keep it similar to the main text size.
  - Unless it's the name of a major module, which can be bold or slightly larger.
  - Explanatory text can be slightly smaller or lighter in color.
- **Alignment**
  - Strive for alignment (width, height, edges, centering, etc.) between modules, especially those at the same level, for better aesthetics.
- **Draw figures in PowerPoint**, then save as an image (for Word templates) or PDF (for LaTeX).

## English
```
Simple is better than complex. 
```
- Use LLMs like DeepSeek, GPT, etc., to assist in checking for spelling and grammatical errors.
- Sentences and word choice should be **simple and direct**. Avoid long sentences and complex clauses. **Subject-verb-object** structure is sufficient.
- **Titles (Subtitles):** Capitalize the first letter of each word, following common practice for English paper titles.
> - Recommended reading: 《[The Elements of Style](EoS_4thEd.pdf)》

- English abbreviations: On **first appearance**, use the format: `Chinese Full Name (English Full Name, Abbreviation)`,
  - E.g., `人脸识别(Face Recognition, FR)`
  - Use half-width commas and parentheses here.

- Expression: Refer to published papers, especially those on the same topic. Do not "invent" your own.

- Prefer simple words:
  - Look up the **English definition** of any word in a dictionary like Youdao to understand its original usage and meaning.
  - Chinese definitions are less reliable for this purpose, as they can be easily confused.
